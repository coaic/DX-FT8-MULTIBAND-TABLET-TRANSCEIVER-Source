For more information about the DX FT8 Multiband Tablet Transceiver please use the

https://github.com/WB2CBA/DX-FT8-FT8-MULTIBAND-TABLET-TRANSCEIVER

repository.

The original sources for the transceiver firmware are stored on a shared google drive (called Katy.zip)

I was unable to build these sources. 
I held an email exchange with Charles Hill, W5BAA. 
Charley supplied me with a very useful PDF to get the sources building using the STM32 Cube IDE. 
I am using the STM32CubeIDE Version: 1.16.1

Unfortunately I was still unable to build the sources due to build errors.
These errors were due to C variables being defined in header files causing multiple definition errors at link time.
I suspect in part this is because Arduino-style C++ code has been converted to C.

The source code contains the sources to the excellent FT8 library by Karlis Goba, YL3JG.
The original repo for the ft8 library is at

https://github.com/kgoba/ft8_lib

I modified the sources to build the firmware successfully.
There are still concerning warnings about potential buffer overflows often I have marked them with TODO's in the code.
I took the opportunity to clean up the code removing most of the unused commented out code, unreferenced variables and so on.
I also used the STM IDE to reformat the code for consistency.
This repo is the result. 
Every release is tested on my own FT8 Transceiver.
